# **Results of Refactored Stock Analysis Code**

## *Overview of Project*
My client Steve requested an updated Excel workbook to quickly analyze the entire stock market over the last few years. I have refactored the VBA script I used to create a green stocks analysis for Steve's parents to handle the expanded datasets and make the VBA script run faster.

## *Results*
**2017:**

```
In 2017 all stocks except TERP had a positive return, suggesting it was overall a year of high performance. The average return was 67.3%, with a maximum return of 199.4% for DQ.
